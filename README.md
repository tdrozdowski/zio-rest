# ZIO-Rest Toolkit
This project is a simple toolkit to help out when building clients for RESTful web services.  It leverages ZIO, ZIO-JSON, and ZIO-HTTP and prefers ZIO 'first' libraries over others.

This is currently experimental and relies on experimental snapshots of various libraries.

It currently supports Scala 2.13.x - in theory it should work with Scala 3.0.x but has not been tested with it (yet).
